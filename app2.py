Here are a few ideas depending on the look you're going for: \n\n â€¢Solid colored t-shirt: A crisp white tee or a black crewneck tee are always failsafe options. You can also go for a grey tee or a jewel tone like emerald green or sapphire blue.\n\nâ€¢Graphic t-shirt:  A graphic tee with a cool print or a band tee can add a touch of personality to your outfit.\n\nâ€¢Striped t-shirt:  A classic striped tee in black and white or navy and white is a laid-back yet polished choice. \n\nYou can choose one of these depending on the requirement."

Here's why: \n\n â€¢Lightweight and breathable: A t-shirt made from cotton or linen will keep you cool and comfortable in the warm weather.\n\n â€¢Relaxed style: A t-shirt offers a casual and laid-back vibe, perfect for a relaxed outing.\n\n â€¢Versatility: You can easily dress it up or down with accessories like a statement necklace, a scarf, or a denim jacket."
